## What is origin/main?

It is local copy of the branch named "main" on the remote named "origin".The origin/main branch is local! Any time you fetch from origin, origin/main will get updated.The origin/main branch is not a reference or pointer to the main branch on origin. It is a local copy.

Since origin/main is a branch, you can merge it. Here's a pull in two steps:

- Step one, fetch main from the remote origin. The main branch on origin will be fetched and the local copy will be named origin/main.

`git fetch origin main`

- Then you merge origin/main into main.

`git merge origin/main`

- Then you can push your new changes in main back to origin:

`git push origin main`
